# Projects Overview

## [Creating analysis-ready data with xradar with Quasi-Vertical Profiles (QVPs)](notebooks/Analysis-Ready/ARCO-Datasets.ipynb)
In this project, students will demonstrate how utilizing radar data in the Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) format enables efficient computation of Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) and Quasi-Vertical Profiles (QVP). The ARCO format ensures that radar data is pre-processed, clean, and well-organized, significantly reducing the time spent on data preparation and cleaning.
