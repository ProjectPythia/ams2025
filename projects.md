## [Creating analysis-ready data with xradar with Quasi-Vertical Profiles (QVPs)](notebooks/Analysis-Ready/ARCO-Datasets.ipynb)
- Science Question: Can the quasi-vertical profile (QVP) technique provide meaningful insights into hail formation and other microphysical processes during convective events?
- Project Scope: Use cloud-optimized, analysis-ready radar data to generate QVPs and identify signatures of heavy rainfall rates or hail formation (e.g., enhanced ZDR, KDP, Z). Success is a reproducible workflow that detects extreme weather/heavy rainfall rates / hail-related microphysical features from volumetric scans.
- Datasets:
  - Calgary Hail Storm 2024 radar data
  - Ontario Derecho 2022 radar data

## Derecho Rainfall Totals with Py-ART

- Science Question: During the 2022 Ontario Derecho, where were the sites most likely to be impacted by flooding? We want to estimate QPE for the storm time period.
- Project Scope: Estimate the plausible range of rainfall totals for the 2022 Ontario Derecho using several QPE estimators.
- Datasets:
  - Derecho (2022052115  to 2022052118)

## Storm Tracking with TITAN and tobac
- Science Question: During the 2024 hail storm, can we identify and track cells including merges and splits?
- Project scope: Animate hail storm track using TITAN and tobac.  Compare storm tracking software.
- Highlights: Results in both netCDF and .csv formats for images & statistical plots. 
- Datasets: Datasets:
  - Dataset 1: Hail (2024080600 to 2024080605)
  - Dataset 2: Derecho (2022052115  to 2022052118)
