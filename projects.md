## [Creating analysis-ready data with xradar with Quasi-Vertical Profiles (QVPs)](notebooks/Analysis-Ready/ARCO-Datasets.ipynb)
In this project, students will demonstrate how utilizing radar data in the Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) format enables efficient computation of Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) and Quasi-Vertical Profiles (QVP). The ARCO format ensures that radar data is pre-processed, clean, and well-organized, significantly reducing the time spent on data preparation and cleaning.

## Derecho Rainfall Totals with Py-ART

- Science Question: During the 2022 Ontario Derecho, where were the sites most likely to be impacted by flooding? We want to estimate QPE for the storm time period.
- Project Scope: Estimate the plausible range of rainfall totals for the 2022 Ontario Derecho using several QPE estimators.
- Datasets:
  - Derecho (2022052115  to 2022052118)

## Storm Tracking with TITAN and tobac
- Science Question: During the 2024 hail storm, can we identify and track cells including merges and splits?
- Project scope: Animate hail storm track using TITAN and tobac.  Compare storm tracking software.
- Highlights: Results in both netCDF and .csv formats for images & statistical plots. 
- Datasets: Datasets:
  - Dataset 1: Hail (2024080600 to 2024080605)
  - Dataset 2: Derecho (2022052115  to 2022052118)
